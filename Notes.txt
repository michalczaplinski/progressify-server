Get the image URL from redis
  it exists -> 
    a) GET the image from storage by the URL
    b) write the image to the request body
    c) respond
    
  it does not exist -> 
    
    - respond with the original image immediately

    then async:
    - transform the image to create a placeholder
    - save the placeholder to storage
    - get the link to file from storage when it is done saving
    - put the `key:value` in redis: `originalimageURL: storageURL`
    

TODO:
  - make sure that there are no edge cases in URL parsing with regex
  - write a fuzz tester that throws a 100 random images at the application
  - test under "NO NETWORK" conditions
